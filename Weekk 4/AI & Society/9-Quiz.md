# Question 1

What are the current limitations of AI technology? (Select all that apply)

- There are no limitations to AI technology

- AI technology can display discriminatory behavior

- Explainability is hard

- AI technology is susceptible to adversarial attacks

- AI technology can be biased

# Question 2

What is the Goldilocks Rule of AI?

- One shouldn’t be too optimistic or too pessimistic about AI technology

- AI’s technology will continue to grow and will solve all of humanity’s problems

- Fearing human extinction due to AI development

- Expecting AI to create Utopia

# Question 3

Say you are building an AI system to help make diagnoses from X-ray scans. Which of the following statements about explainability of AI do you agree with?

- AI systems are intrinsically “black box” and cannot give any explanation for their outputs.

- Most AI systems are highly explainable, making it easy for a doctor to understand and give a particular diagnosis.

- Explainability is usually achieved through building a chatbot to talk to the user to explain its outputs.

- Lack of explainability can hamper users’ willingness to trust and adopt an AI system.

# Question 4

Using current AI technology, if a machine learning system learns from text containing unhealthy biases/stereotypes, then the resulting AI software tends to exhibit similarly unhealthy biases/stereotypes.

- True

- False

# Question 5

Using current AI technology, if a machine learning system learns only from text that is completely neutral and does not reflect any gender biases, then we would expect it to exhibit no, or at most minimal, gender bias.

- True

- False

# Question 6

What are recommended practices for mitigating bias in AI? (Select all that apply)

- Technical solution such as “zeroing out” bias

- Using an adversarial attack on the AI system to change its outputs to be less biased

- Using more inclusive/less biased data

- Systematic auditing processes to check for bias

# Question 7

Which of these are examples of adversarial attacks on an AI system? (Select all that apply)

- Subtly modifying an audio clip to make a speech recognition system think someone said “Yes, authorized” when they actually said “No, reject.”

- Using AI to synthesize a fake video of a politician saying something they never actually said.

- Subtly altering an image to mislead an AI system into mistakenly recognizing a dog as a cat.

- Adding a sticker to a stop sign to make an AI system fail to detect it.

# Question 8

If a developing economy has a strong and thriving coffee bean manufacturing industry (or any other vertical industry), then it has an advantage in applying AI to that that industry.

True

False

# Question 9

In the decade or so, which jobs are most likely to be displaced by AI?

- All jobs will be displaced

- Most jobs related to office work (white collar jobs)

- Jobs that primarily involve routine, repetitive tasks

- Jobs that mainly involve non-routine, non-repetitive tasks

# Question 10

Congratulations! You deserve a pat on the back for finishing this course.

- True

- False
